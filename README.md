Python Kata Base
================

Use this repository to bootstrap a code kata written in Python.

It is set up with Python's built-in [unittest][] module plus an automated
tool called [sniffer][] to re-run tests and [generate code coverage][coverage]
when you save files 

Simply run:

    . python-env.sh

to install and activate the virtual environment in your shell.
